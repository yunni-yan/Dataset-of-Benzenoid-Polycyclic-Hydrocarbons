# Dataset-of-Benzenoid-Polycyclic-Hydrocarbons
Corresponding database for the paper "Triangle Counting Rule: An Approach to Forecast the Magnetic Properties of Benzenoid Polycyclic Hydrocarbons".


Dataset(h=7): The example of giving all Benzenoid Polycyclic Hydrocarbons with seven benzene rings.   
h=7_combinations.txt: All combinations of benzene ring numbers that meet the requirements (including a large number of repetitions).  
h=7.csv: The database after deduplication.  
h=7.py: The code to produce 'h=7_combinations.txt'  
h=7.txt: The relative coordinates of each C atom in the structure.
   
	
Model:
Code for four algorithms for magnetic prediction of molecules in the dataset using feature 1.
